# Network Lab ‚Äì MQSH 2025  
*Hands-on introduction to network analysis in social sciences, health, and neuroscience*

This repository contains interactive Jupyter notebooks prepared for the practical workshop at the **Colloque M√©thodes quantitatives en sciences humaines (et sant√©)**, held in person on June 5‚Äì6, 2025, at the MIL Campus of Universit√© de Montr√©al (rooms AB1007, B2061, and A3541).

## Overview

Many phenomena in social sciences, health, and neuroscience arise from complex webs of interactions ‚Äî between individuals, symptoms, brain regions, or social variables. These relational structures span multiple scales, from neurons to societies, and often resist traditional quantitative approaches.

Network science provides a formal framework to represent and analyze such complexity. Rooted in graph theory and enriched by contributions from physics, computer science, and biology, it offers tools to better understand the interdependence underlying many biological and human systems.

This workshop offers an accessible introduction through practical exercises and real-world examples. No programming experience is required.
